I can see the issue. The functions framework is looking for a function named `main`, but your `/content/main.py` file doesn't have one. Let me first examine the file to understand its current structure.
I see the issue. Your Flask app is set up correctly, but the Google Cloud Functions framework expects a function named `main`. You need to add a `main` function that serves as the entry point for the Cloud Functions deployment. This function should wrap your Flask app.

Let me fix this:
Perfect! I've added a `main` function to your `main.py` file. This function:

1. **Acts as the entry point** for Google Cloud Functions framework
2. **Wraps your Flask app** using the WSGI interface by calling `app()` with the request environment
3. **Maintains local development compatibility** - your existing `if __name__ == '__main__'` block still allows running locally with `python main.py`

Now the functions framework should be able to find and load the `main` function. You can try running the framework again with:

```bash
functions-framework --target=main --debug
```
