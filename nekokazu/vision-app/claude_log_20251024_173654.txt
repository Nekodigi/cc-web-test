I understand you're getting an API key validation error and need help creating a deployable Cloud Function. Let me break down what you're asking for:

1. Create `main.py` (deployable to Cloud Functions with entry-point=main) that runs on port 3000
2. Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies
3. Create an `index.html` with Tailwind CSS
4. Use available environment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `Mapbox`, `GoogleAIStudio`, `DEVELOPER_ID`, `APP_ID`
5. Work within `pracClass/$DEVELOPER_ID/apps/$app_id` directory
6. Minimize Firebase Web SDK usage (no login features to reduce bugs)

Let me start by understanding your project structure and requirements better.
First, let me check the current directory structure:
Good! The files already exist. Let me check what's currently in them:
Now I see the issue! The problem is:

**The API key being used is incorrect.** Your code is using `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, but it's trying to use Google Generative AI (Gemini). This requires a **Google AI Studio API key**, not an OpenAI key.

Let me fix the code:
Now let me update the requirements.txt with the latest versions:
Let me check the index.html:
Good! The HTML looks fine. Now let me update my todo list and provide you with the key information:
## Summary of Changes

**The issue:** Your code was trying to use `OPENAI_API_KEY` with Google Generative AI (Gemini), which requires a different API key type.

### What I've fixed:

1. **main.py (line 14)** - Changed API key configuration:
   - Now checks for `GOOGLE_AI_KEY` or `GoogleAIStudio` environment variable
   - Previously was incorrectly looking for `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **requirements.txt** - Updated to latest versions:
   - Added `functions-framework==3.7.0` (required for Cloud Functions deployment)
   - Updated Flask, Werkzeug, and gunicorn to latest stable versions

### To fix the API key error:

You need to set the environment variable with a valid **Google AI Studio API key**:

```bash
export GoogleAIStudio="your-google-ai-studio-key"
# or
export GOOGLE_AI_KEY="your-google-ai-studio-key"
```

Get your key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Files are ready for deployment:
- ✅ **main.py** - Flask app with Cloud Functions entry point
- ✅ **requirements.txt** - All dependencies with latest versions
- ✅ **index.html** - Tailwind CSS UI already configured

The app is now configured correctly and ready to deploy to Google Cloud Functions!
