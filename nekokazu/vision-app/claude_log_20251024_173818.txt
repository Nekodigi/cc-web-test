The error indicates that Flask version 3.1.3 doesn't exist in the package repository. According to the available versions listed, the latest Flask 3.1.x version available is **3.1.2**.

To fix this, you have a few options:

1. **Use the latest available 3.1.x version:**
   ```
   Flask==3.1.2
   ```

2. **Use a flexible version constraint:**
   ```
   Flask>=3.1.0,<3.2.0
   ```

3. **Use the latest available version:**
   ```
   Flask>=3.1.2
   ```

Which approach would you like to use? If you're working with a `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` file, I can help you update it to use an available version.
